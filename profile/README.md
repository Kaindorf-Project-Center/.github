# Kaindorf-Projects-Center

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Kaindorf-Projects-Center, a centralized collection of open-source repositories for the students of HTL Kaindorf. We are a group of three students from AHIF21 who are passionate about coding, collaborating, and sharing knowledge. Our organization hosts a variety of projects, including school-related games and software with specific use cases within our school.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to create a collaborative environment where students can contribute to and benefit from open-source projects tailored to the needs and interests of the HTL Kaindorf community. Whether it's developing educational tools, creating fun games, or working on software solutions for school-related challenges, we believe in the power of collective effort and shared knowledge.


## How to Contribute

### Forking an Existing Repository

We welcome contributions from all students of HTL Kaindorf! If you have an idea, a bug fix, or an improvement, feel free to contribute. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:
1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to.
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/awesome-feature` or `fix/bug-issue`).
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
4. **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
5. **Create a Pull Request** to the original repository with a detailed description of your changes.

### Suggesting New Projects

Do you have an idea for a new project? Weâ€™d love to hear it! Feel free to suggest new projects that you think would benefit our community. Just message us on Discord with your proposal.
